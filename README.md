This repository is meant to demonstrate the functions of a few features of our STA 141B Final Project. In our project, we created the csv files in this repository from scratch, however, as to not burden any third parties who would like to run this code, we converted our data frames into csv files. We, ourselves, did NOT use any previously generated csv files in our accumulation of data. All the csv files must be downloaded to run the ipynub code and please run these ipynub files on a Jupyter Notebook!
